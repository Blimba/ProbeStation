#   Modular Probe Station Script
#
#   Author: Bart Limburg
#   Version: May 2017
#
#   Usage:
#
#       This script file takes care of automated movement over devices.
#       For every device, 1 or more script files are called (explained below)
#
#       The script can import a file with a list of devices to loop over.
#       A csv file should be supplied. For example: a1,b2,g6
#       This would loop over those 3 devices. However, also ranges can be supplied
#       For example: a,c-e,f30-h3 would perform the entire column a (from the minimum row to the maximum row, defined below)
#       followed by the entire columns c, d and e. Lastly, it loops over devices f30 to the maximum number in column f,
#       do the entire column g, then from the minimum row of column h, to h3.
#       Lastly, supply * to loop over all devices on the defined chip.
#
#       Your experiment script should have two basic functions:
#
#       def init(qt):
#           In this function, define the instrument(s) that you will use. For example:
#           return qt.instruments.create('femto_dlpca_200','FEMTO_DLPCA_200',dev=1)
#           It is possible to return multiple devices, or perform other actions in this function
#           The qtlab object "qt" is passed to the script, as the script does not have native access to the variable.
#
#       def start(qt,instr,name,dev):
#           This function is called by the main script for every device over which it loops.
#           The qtlab object "qt" and the instrument(s) returned by the init function are passed to the function.
#           In addition, the experiment name "name" and the current device "dev" are also passed.
#           This function is the heart of the script. Perform whatever you want to do for each device here.
#           For example, measure your IVtraces, perform electroburning, electroannealing, or whatever.
#           Optionally, the function may return a (list of) value(s) that will be saved in an expinfo file.
#           If you return the word "STOP" (or the word you set in the user customisable section below) the experiment
#           will stop automated movement and quit the application.
#
#       optionally, your script may contain the following function:
#
#       def end(qt,instr,name):
#           This function is called after all devices have been looped over. The qt object "qt", your instruments and the experiment name are passed to the function.
#           If your instruments require a shutdown command (or you want to terminate other things), do so here.
#
