'''

This part of the script defines the chip architecture and the devices on the chip. You can easily load different chips
from template files or directly define it from the script. Then, you can load a part of the chip to list devices on.

For example, you can load the T2.ini chip template, which has columns a to w, and row 1 to 38, of which row 38 is
shorted. Then, you can load devices on column a only, to create a run list for the devices on column a only.

User callable functions:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

__init__(name, **kwargs):

initialises the chip class. Usage:
c=Chip(experiment_name)

You may pass a template here too (see below for load_template) like so:
c=Chip(experiment_name, template='2T.ini')

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

c.define_devices(device_square, position=(0,0), pitch=(0,0), hide_from_range=False)

define a chip architecture. For the T2 chip, we would run this function twice:
c.define_devices('a1-w37', (0,0), (400, 200), False)
c.define_devices('a38-w38', (0, 7400), (400, 200), True)

First, the 'normal' area of the chip is defined. The devices a1 to w37 define a square including all devices in between
the column and row numbers (i.e., a1-b2 would include a1, a2, b1 and b2). The initial position of device a1 is (0,0),
i.e., 0 for x and 0 for y. The spacing between devices (pitch) is 400 for x and 200 for y. The devices are not hidden
from the range (see c.load_devices below).

Then, we include the shorted devices on row 38. The devices a38-w38 include all columns for row 38. The position of the
first device (a38) is at 0 for x and 7400 for y. The pitch is the same as before. These devices are hidden from the
range (see c.load_devices below).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

c.load_template(filename, ignore_hidden=True)

Loads a chip template from a file. Chip template files should have lines corresponding to:
device_range, (position_x, position_y), (pitch_x, pitch_y)

The word 'hidden' may be added to the start of the line to indicate these devices should be hidden from the range (see
c.load_devices below).

Other lines in the file will be ignored by the script (to be sure, add # as a comment to the start of the line).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

c.load_devices(device_range)

This function creates the 'run list' of the devices (see c.devices below). This means that you can only load a part of
the devices on the chip to run. The device_range here works differently than the square method described above. Instead,
it will run column by column.

For example, on the T2 chip:
c.load_devices('a') # would list a1-a37
Note: a38 is NOT added to the list because it is hidden from the device range (see above). You could run it by
specifically calling c.load_devices('a1-a38')

Other examples:
c.load_devices('a3') # would list only device a3
c.load_devices('a3-6') # would list devices a3, a4, a5 and a6
c.load_devices('a36-b2') # would list devices a36, a37, b1 and b2
c.load_devices('a-c') # would list all the devices on columns a, b and c (except row 38, because it is hidden)
c.load_devices('a38') # would list only device a38 (even though it is hidden, you can still access it)
c.load_devices('*') # lists all the devices on the chip

Ranges may be subsequently added by comma separation:
c.load_devices('a3,a3-6') # this would list a3 twice, followed by a4, a5 and a6.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

c.load_from_file(filename)

Loads the device range from a file. See c.load_devices above for details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

c.start_at_device(dev,run_skipped_devices=False)

Sorts the device list (see c.devices below) to start at a certain device in the list. If run_skipped_devices is False,
the list will exclude the devices that were on the list prior to the device specified. For example, the following code
would generate a list containing devices a35, a36 and a37, ignoring the other devices:
c.load_devices('a')
c.start_at_device('a35',False)

Otherwise, the following code would be equivalent to c.load_devices('a35-37,a1-34'):
c.load_devices('a')
c.start_at_device('a35',True)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

c.add_experiment(script_file,devices='*'):

defines an experiment for a device square (so, like in c.define_devices, not a range like in c.load_devices).
For example:
c.add_experiment('test','a1-b2')
would add the experiment 'test' to the experiment list for devices a1, a2, b1 and b2 only. For the other devices, no
experiment (or another experiment) are run.
You may add as many experiments as you see fit, and multiple experiments may be added to the same device; in such a
case, the experiments will be run in order that they were added.

The experiment 'test' will need an addition python file in the main script directory, called test.py. This file will
need specific functions, as explained in the documentation of main.py.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

c.get_device_position(dev)

Returns the device position as a tuple of shape (position_x, position_y). Obviously, this only works for devices that
are defined on the chip. If the device is not on the chip, the position (-1, -1) is returned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

c.get_device_from_position(position)

Returns the device at a certain position (input a tuple of shape (position_x, position_y). If the position does not
contain a device, an empty string is returned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

c.devices # property

This is the list of devices that should be run on the chip, and is populated by c.load_devices or by c.load_from_file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

c.experiments

This is the list of experiments that are populated by c.add_experiment. As seen in main.py, the correct way of running
experiments on the loaded devices is:

for device in c.devices:
    # move cascade here
    for experiment in c.experiments:
        experiment.run(device)

Note: the cascade movement is NOT included in this code. The experiment.run code checks if the experiment should be run
for the device, and otherwise nothing is returned.
